# Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to [`http://localhost:4200/`](http://localhost:4200/). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

# Build

Run `ng build:lib` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Publishing

Run `npm publish dist/@postfinance/ngx-ace-editor-wrapper` on `release` in order to publish the artifact.

### Canary and `beta`

Don't forget to add `--tag beta` when publishing from `canary` branch.

# Running Tests

> Tests will be added soon.

## Unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
